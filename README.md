# Movie Ratings - CSCI1951a

The goal of this project is to determine what factors or statistics are important to the success of a movie. To answer this, we analyze how different movie metrics (the lead actor, language, movie budget, etc) correlate to a movie's average IMDb rating.

Our motivation is to determine how important factors like budget are to a movieâ€™s success, hopefully to broaden the knowledge of what really affects a movie's rating.

## Data Deliverable

Our data is scraped from [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets/all) and downloaded from [IMDb](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/). The original data can be found at those two links. More details on how this data was retrieved, how you could retrieve it, and its specifications are included in `data_spec.md` files for each dataset.
