## Notes on gross month visualization

- Why did you pick this representation? 

    - The bar chart representation is clean and efficient to communicate the world wide gross income with respect to the month of the movie's release. This way, there are clear peaks in June and December, which is consistent with the our intuition as these are two biggest holiday seasons.

- What alternative ways might you communicate the result? 

    - There are a number of visualizations that could work for this task. For example, tracking the income with a line chart or with a pie chart would be sufficient as well, but the spacing could be a question. 

- Were there any challenges visualizing the results, if so, what were they? 

    -  Since we were already working with a pandas dataframe, it was pretty straightforward to compile this visualization using matplotlib's pyplot. 

- Will your visualization require text to provide context or is it standalone (either is fine, but itâ€™s recognized which type your visualization is)?

    - We think that this could serve as a standalone visualization, as it is pretty intuitive to understand from the title and the labels that we are talking about how well movie's that are released during a certain month are doing.
